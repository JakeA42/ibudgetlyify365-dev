Ideas:  
Budget tracker - Users can track their expenses and income to create a budget. The backend would need to store information such as transaction details, budget categories, and budget limits.

Calendar events - Users can create, edit, and delete events on their calendar. The backend would need to store information such as event name, start time, end time, and location.

Airport management - track passengers, flights, and tickets. Records added or modified when an airline schedules a flight and when a passenger books a flight or cancels
