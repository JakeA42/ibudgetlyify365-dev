Ideas:  
Budget tracker - Users can track their expenses and income to create a budget. The backend would need to store information such as transaction details, budget categories, and budget limits.

Stock market data analysis - Users can view and analyze stock market data. The backend would need to store historical and real-time stock market data, as well as provide analytical tools for users to analyze the data.

Calendar events - Users can create, edit, and delete events on their calendar. The backend would need to store information such as event name, start time, end time, and location.
